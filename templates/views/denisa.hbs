        <p class="font1">1. Spectacle

Graphic by the author.
Window management on Mac can be a pain at times, especially if all you have is the 13" laptop’s modest display. Every square inch on the screen matters when you have multi-application, multi-window workflows like me. For easy window snapping, I use Spectacle on a daily basis.
Spectacle has customisable keyboard shortcuts, however the defaults are very intuitive and require just a few tries to become habitual. Not to mention, this helpful app sits at the top of the screen in the menu bar, like most of the apps I have in this list. Almost like a widget, you only need to click the spectacles icon if you want to quit the app, customize it, or simply remind yourself of the keyboard shortcuts at a glance. No Googling required!
A few of the shortcuts I use every day are:
⌥ + ⌘ + ← moves window to the right half of the screen
⌥ + ⌘ + → moves window to the left half of the screen
⌃ + ⌥ + ⌘→ moves window to the external display
⌘ + F makes window occupy the whole screen
2. FlyCut

Graphic by the author.
I’m a power user, okay, guys? I cmd+C/cmd+V a lot. This means that I struggle without a clipboard manager, and FlyCut is my go-to. When I am coding, it happens often that I copy something, then I forget all about it as I carry on debugging and I eventually copy something else on top of it. Now the original copied text is gone forever, lost among thousands of lines of code in no-man’s-land...
Or not. Fly cut is extremely lightweight, extremely easy to use from the get-go and very intuitive. You don’t need to waste any time learning a new workflow, all you need to do is:
⌘ + ⌥ + V
FlyCut will then present you a list of recent copied items, which can be as long as you need it to be. I set mine to about 50 recent items. Simply use the arrows , or scroll with the mouse/trackpad to navigate to the desired copied text in the clipboard history.
Key limitation: In my experience, FlyCut does not save anything but text. If you work a lot with images and other types of data, you’ll probably need to look for a paid clipboard manager.
3. Fanny

Graphic by the author.
Admit it: your heart trembles every time you drink a glass of water near your Mac. Worse still, you’re probably having intrusive thoughts about bad things happening to your Mac all the time. It would be so easy to spill some water on it by accident, wouldn’t it? It would be so easy to drop it on the floor. It would be so easy to forget yourself on public transport and lay back against your backpack too heavily, and when you get home, lo and behold: the screen is cracked. No? Is it just me? Okay.
However, as disastrous as these events would be, they are not very likely to be what breaks your computer in the end. The number one reason why laptops eventually break is sustained thermal pressure on the internals.
Us, MacBook users, have to be very wary of thermal pressure. The laptops are so thin and the vents are so small and inconspicuous, that it is very easy for the CPU to reach high temperatures during your typical workflow. With hours-long Zoom meetings and other processes running concomitantly, it’s not getting any better for your Mac.
When you’re pushing it hard, have you wondered what the CPU temperature is? In comes Fanny. Fanny will display your fan RPM, CPU and GPU temperatures by reading the internal sensors. This is displayed at the top of the screen in the menu bar, so that you can monitor the CPU temperature at all times during usage.
4. Keeping You Awake

Graphic by the author.
It’s always the obscure things that you need the most. Keeping You Awake is a simple menu bar widget that, when clicked, prevents your Mac from going to sleep. It’s as easy as that. No faff.
My typical use case for this widget is when I want to step away from the computer and I don’t want my work VPN to disconnect because of the Mac going to sleep. As incredible as it sounds, MacOS does not have a built-in functionality that prevents the Mac from going to sleep. The computer will go to sleep eventually to save power, sooner or later.
With this widget, you can set a timer, or you can turn it on and off manually from the menu bar.
A daily go-to before my lunch break is to click on the coffee cup icon in the menu bar, turn down the screen brightness to zero and enjoy a ‘sleeping’ Mac without any disruption to the ongoing processes.
5. Joplin

Graphic by the author.
I have to be honest with you: I’m no productivity guru. I don’t have nay opinions on the ongoing debate about the best to-do list app/note taking app/organisation app. I am what you would call… a casual productivity app user. I use Notion too, actually, but I’m not weird about it, I promise.
However, what sold me on Joplin was the fact that it is based on Markdown. I use Markdown daily in my code notebooks (proud R notebook user here…). This software also enables you to print your Markdown notes to PDF with one click. Meeting minutes formatted impeccably and ready to send around? Yes please.
Furthermore, Joplin is a good space for tickable to-do lists. I use it to keep track on my work-related backlog. Each month, I create a new backlog and click and drag any unresolved tasks from the previous month.
I also use Joplin to store haphazard meeting notes, Bash scripts, commands and other bits and pieces I would normally have saved in text files or, God forbid, Word documents. Everything on this software is highly searchable synchronizable between devices. 10 out of 10.
6. TextMate

Graphic by the author.
People swear by their code editors and IDEs, I get it. However, if you do a lot of work at the command line like me, 9 out of 10 times you won’t need a clunky IDE to get by. Every day, I just need a text editor to copy/paste commands for easy editing (cue FlyCut…). The built-in TextEdit is not bad for this purpose, but it lacks the programmer-oriented focus of TextMate.
This text editor has a handy smart recognition feature that can tell the language you are scripting in. This prompts the colour scheme to change according to your language of choice without needing any manual input. The find/replace functionality on TextMate is also very good.
